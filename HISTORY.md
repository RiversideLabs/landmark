With this release, `connect-mongo` has been removed from Landmarks's `package.json` and all three supported session store packages are optional. If you specify one, be sure to include it as a dependency in your project's `package.json` (Landmark will warn you on startup if you haven't).

Because of the way **npm** resolved paths, if you are using Landmark in development mode (via `npm link`) *and* using a session store, you have to `npm install <session-store>` in your local Landmark folder as well or it won't find the package.

## v0.2.0 / 2014-01-26

A bumper release for the new year! We've moved to v0.2.x because some packages have been updated to new minor versions that may cause compatibility issues, specifically:

LandmarkJS now requires mongoose 3.8.5+. Please test compatibility with your application before deploying this update to production.

This version also requires Jade 1.x, which includes some breaking changes from the 0.x branch, particularly to doctype definition. Updating your app should be simple, but again, be sure to test before deploying to production.

One of the other big changes in this release is the work done by [Iulian Meghea](https://github.com/iulian-meghea) breaking up all the field templates into individual files, in preparation for introducing field type plugins in the future.
